## Placeholder

This page is a placeholder for governance information.

The questions that we'd like to answer include:

* What happens when a user violates server rules?
* What happens when a remote user or instance are harmful to our community?
* How do we respond to questions and reports?
* How do we onboard moderators and admin?
* How do we decide how to govern ourselves?
