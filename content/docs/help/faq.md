## Do I need to live in Dayton, OH to have an account?

No, but we do ask that you have some sort of connection to the area to use this instance. Anyone in the Dayton and surrounding metropolitan areas are welcome.

## Do I need an invite?

Registration is open, but new accounts must provide a brief example of their connection to Dayton. Existing users may invite others which bypasses that requirement.

## Where is this hosted?

This server is physically located in central Ohio. That means that us Ohio locals will have very quick server responses and our data is geographically close to us.

## How can I support this instance?

As the size of the community grows, so do server costs. Donations are accepted at https://liberapay.com/ngerakines/donate.
