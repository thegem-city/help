## What is account migration?

It's possible (and common) to have more than one account in the fediverse. It is pretty common for people to create an account on one of the larger starter instances and then move over to an instance that they feel more aligned with.

## How do I migrate to thegem.city?

The migration process is pretty simple:

The first step is to create the account on the new server.

Then, on that new server, under your profile preferences is a section "Moving from a different account". On there you put in the activitypub user/server for the server you are moving from.

Then on the old server, go to profile preferences section "Move to a different account" and put in the new account/server you are moving two.
