## Before You Join

This instance is focused on serving Dayton, Ohio and the surrounding areas. We kindly ask that only those located in or connected to the area join.

Please take a moment to review the [Code of Conduct](../server/code-of-conduct/) as well.

## Picking a Username

Your username will be your unique identifier on this server. When combined with the server address, it will be how people across the fediverse see who you are and what server you are on.

For example, the username for the server may be "nick" but when combined with the server hostname it is "nick@thegem.city".

There is no requirement that you use your real name in your username, but a lot of people do. We suggest you use your name, a combination of your first, middle, or last name, or a nickname.

**Note:** Your username and your display name are different. For example, you can have the username "nick" and also set the displayed name to "Nick G".

## Using a String Password

Although we take your privacy and safety seriously, bad things happen. Please use a strong, unique password.

## Joining

To join the server, you'll need a valid email address that you have access to.

1. Visit <a href="https://thegem.city/">https://thegem.city/</a>
2. Use the account creation form to enter your username, email address, and password.
3. Give a brief explanation as to how you are associated with Dayton, Ohio.

### What About Bots?

TBD

## Account Approval

Once you create an account, it won't immediately be available to use. You'll need to verify your email address and wait for your account to be approved.

If you are creating an account using an invite link, you won't need to wait for your account to be approved.

## Your First Post

All new accounts are strongly encouraged to create an introductory post. This can be as simple as saying who are you and what your interests are, or it can be more involved.
