## Unlist Replies

Sometimes a reply to a message isn't worth clogging up feeds. When replying to a post, you can set the visibility to "Unlisted". The person you are replying to will still be notified of the reply, but it won't be listed on your public feed.

## CamelCase Tags

Use tags written in [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) to make it easier for screen readers. All tags are normalized, so this small act of making your content more accessible does not reduce the number of people who will see it.

## Common Tags

Tags are a great way to organize content and also get your message across to specific communities and interested parties. Here are some of the tags that we've seen used for this purpose:

* `#introduction` -- Used for user introductions within a server and the fediverse.
* `#mastodon` -- Used to discuss Mastodon, the activitypub implementation, and often the larger Mastodon community.
* `#fediverse` -- Used to discuss the greater Fediverse that is comprised of ActivityPub implementations and the people who are on those instances.
* `#admin` and `#mastoadmin` -- Used to dicuss the administration of Mastodon and fediverse servers
* `#fediblock` -- Used to discuss public information about reports, blocks, and defederation. Is often a mix of direct information as well as discussions about the topic of moderation.

## Use Content Warnings

A content warning (aka "cw") doesn't mean that something is NSFW or offensive, but rather you're giving someone the heads up that the content of the post may be something that they are sensitive to.

Using content warnings is also outlined in our [code of conduct](../../server/code-of-conduct/) for sexual and violent content. Not using a content warning will  result in account moderation.

The general practice is to provide a content warning more often than not. For some content that may be triggering or jarring, using a content warning is essential. This is especially true when considering the federated nature of public posts: they aren't just viewed by your followers, but by anyone viewing content on a server that federates with ours.

There is no defined or set list of things (other than nost listed in our server rules) to apply content warnings to, but here are some suggestions:

* Anything sexually explicit or suggestive. This includes NSFW content that may involve nudity, but also extends to thirst posts and adult humor. There is a lot of grey area.
* News or current events. This also includes discussions or talks about war and displacement.
* Politics.
* Discussions that have been exhausted. For example, Twitter and Elon Musk are subjects that have had a lot of activity and if you are aware that society needs to move on from those subjects, but still have something to say, use a content warning.
