## Unlist Replies

Sometimes a reply to a message isn't worth clogging up feeds. When replying to a post, you can set the visibility to "Unlisted". The person you are replying to will still be notified of the reply, but it won't be listed on your public feed.

## CamelCase Tags

Use tags written in [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) to make it easier for screen readers. All tags are normalized, so this small act of making your content more accessible does not reduce the number of people who will see it.

## Common Tags

Tags are a great way to organize content and also get your message across to specific communities and interested parties. Here are some of the tags that we've seen used for this purpose:

* `#introduction` -- Used for user introductions within a server and the fediverse.
* `#mastodon` -- Used to discuss Mastodon, the activitypub implementation, and often the larger Mastodon community.
* `#fediverse` -- Used to discuss the greater Fediverse that is comprised of ActivityPub implementations and the people who are on those instances.
* `#admin` and `#mastoadmin` -- Used to dicuss the administration of Mastodon and fediverse servers
* `#fediblock` -- Used to discuss public information about reports, blocks, and defederation. Is often a mix of direct information as well as discussions about the topic of moderation.
